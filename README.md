# Product-Platform
This is my first programming project that I started 1 year ago when I entered the world of programming. It is a simple one, a platform where the user can add some products and after submitting the form, all the products are listed on the main page. The user has the possibility to delete the products after checking the boxes and pressing "mass delete". For both actions, a confirmation message will appear to inform the user.
